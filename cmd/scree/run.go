commands:

  compare <before.json> <after.json>  compare two saved JSON reports and print the comparison

Run scree audit --help for the audit flags and terms.
Run scree baseline --help for the baseline flags.

const baselineHelp = `usage: scree baseline [path] [--config <file>] [--out <file>] [--quiet]

The command audits the Go module at path, which defaults to the current directory, and writes
the report as JSON with repo.root set to . and meta.durationMs set to 0. The same files,
configuration, and versions then give the same bytes on any machine. The file is a valid
--baseline for scree audit and an argument for scree compare.
The audit leaves the output file out, so the file does not count as an unsupported file.

flags:
  --config <file>  read the configuration from the file, not from scree.yaml at the path
  --out <file>     write the baseline to the file, default scree-baseline.json at the path
  --quiet          do not print the line that names the written file
  --help, -h       print this help
`

const compareHelp = `usage: scree compare <before.json> <after.json> [--json|--md]

The command compares two reports that scree audit --out saved. It runs no audit.
Exit code 2 means the reports are not comparable.

flags:
  --json      print the comparison as JSON
  --md        print the comparison as Markdown
  --help, -h  print this help
`

const auditHelp = `usage: scree audit <path> [--config <file>] [--baseline <report.json>] [--json|--md] [--out <file>] [--quiet]

flags:
  --config <file>           read the configuration from the file, not from scree.yaml at the path
  --baseline <report.json>  compare with a report that scree audit --out saved, and run the policy checks that need a baseline
  --json                    print the report as JSON
  --md                      print the report as Markdown
  --out <file>              write the report to the file, in the format of --json, --md, the .json or .md extension, else text
  --quiet                   do not print the line that names the written file
  --help, -h                print this help

terms:
  index            0 to 100, the structural debt of the production code, lower is better
  production/test  the measured sets, test holds _test.go files and classify.test matches, production the other measured Go files
  cc               the cyclomatic complexity of one function
  p50/p90/max      the median, the 90th percentile, and the highest cc of a set
  eroded           the functions with cc above 10, with their share of the set mass
  mass             the cc of a function times the square root of its source lines
  clones           the groups of repeated code of at least 100 tokens and 3 lines
  dup lines        the source lines in clones, with their share of the set lines
  partial          a production input failed or hit a cap, so the index counts that part as full debt
  baseline         a saved report of an earlier audit, compared by index, metrics, and findings
  policy           the config file checks that fail the run with exit code 2, like a baseline scree cannot compare
  safeguards       process checks the repo declares, reported but never scored
